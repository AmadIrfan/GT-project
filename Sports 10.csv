The Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) is the governing body in Pakistan.The origin of football in Pakistan can be traced back to the mid  nineteenth century when the game was introduced during the British Raj. Initially  games were played between army teams. However  clubs were soon set up around the country.[42] One of the regional federations to organize football on what is now Pakistan Territory was the North  West India Football Association  in which clubs from the city of Lahore and the surrounding region were active.[43] Kohat FC was the first club to be established in 1930  it became the first outstation team to win the North  West India Football Championship 1937 in 1937 defeating Government College Lahore 1Â–0 in the finals.[43] The first female club to be established was Diya W.F.C. in 2002.Shortly after the creation of Pakistan in 1947  the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) was created  and Muhammad Ali Jinnah became its first Patron  in  Chief. PFF received recognition from FIFA in early 1948.[45] The annual National Championship was organized shortly after. In 1950  the national team gained their first international experience in Iran and Iraq.The Pakistan Football Federation Women Organizing Committee (PFFWOC) is responsible for women  s football in Pakistan. In 2004  the Pakistan Premier League was established  it is the first division of Pakistani football. The Pakistan National Football Challenge Cup is the national   knockout   cup competition in Pakistani football  run by the Pakistan Football Federation. The Pakistan National Women  s Football Championship is the annual women  s championship.

A women  s team was formed in 2017. A major national tournament was organized in 2018.[48] Australia sent a coach to assist Pakistan in 2019 however the sport  s rapid growth in popularity was greatly outpacing local officials ability to support it.[49] 10 of Pakistan  s more than 15 clubs contested the 2021 AFL Pakistan National Championships in Islamabad. Pakistan sent a team to the Asian Championship in 2022  however met some roadblocks to participation due to funding.[51] Despite challenges sending a team  it won the Division 3 title.[52] In 2022 AFL Asia reported that Pakistan was the largest and fastest growing nation for the sport in Asia with over 5 000 players with a 45% annual increase in participation.[53] The Pakistan national side are known as the Dragoons.Upon Pakistan  s independence in 1947  both East and West wings of the country inherited the football infrastructure of the British Raj.[3][4] The need for establishing a nationwide football association to govern the game properly was urgent  since India had inherited the erstwhile Calcutta  based Indian Football Association and the All  India Football Federation (AIFF). As games  chess and basketball are obviously different from leapfrog and playing house. The first two games are competitive  the second two are not. One can win a game of basketball  but it makes no sense to ask who has won a game of leapfrog. In other words  chess and basketball are contests.
