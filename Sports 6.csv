Sports,As can be seen in Mughal art of the 16th and 17th centuries  aristocratic Indianslike their counterparts throughout Asiaused their bows and arrows for hunting as well as for archery contests. Mounted hunters demonstrated equestrian as well as toxophilite skills. The Asian aristocrats passion for horses  which can be traced as far back as Hittite times  if not earlier  led not only to horse races (universal throughout Asia) but also to the development of polo and a host of similar equestrian contests. These equestrian games may in fact be the most distinctive Asian contribution to the repertory of modern sports.In all probability  polo evolved from a far rougher game played by the nomads of Afghanistan and Central Asia. In the form that survived into the 21st century  Afghan buzkashi is characterized by a dusty melee in which hundreds of mounted tribesmen fought over the headless carcass of a goat. The winner was the hardy rider who managed to grab the animal by the leg and drag it clear of the pack. Since buzkashi was clearly an inappropriate passion for a civilized monarch  polo filled the bill. Persian manuscripts from the 6th century refer to polo played during the reign of Hormuz I (271273). The game was painted by miniaturists and celebrated by Persian poets such as Ferdows? (c. 935c. 1020) and ??fe? (1325/261389/90). By 627 polo had spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and had reached China  where it became a passion among those wealthy enough to own horses. (All 16 emperors of the Tang dynasty [618907] were polo players.) As with most sports  the vast majority of polo players were male  but the 12th  century Persian poet Ne??m? commemorated the skills of Princess Sh?r?n. Moreover  if numerous terra  cotta figures can be trusted as evidence  polo was also played by aristocratic Chinese women.There were also ball games for ordinary men and women. Played with carefully sewn stuffed skins  with animal bladders  or with found objects as simple as gourds  chunks of wood  or rounded stones  ball games are universal. Ball games of all sorts were quite popular among the Chinese. Descriptions of the game cuju  which resembled modern football (soccer)  appeared as early as the Eastern Han dynasty (25220). Games similar to modern badminton were also played in the 1st century. Finally  the Ming dynasty (13681644) scroll painting Grove of Violets depicts elegantly attired ladies playing chuiwan  a game similar to modern golf.Sports were unquestionably common in ancient Egypt  where pharaohs used their hunting prowess and exhibitions of strength and skill in archery to demonstrate their fitness to rule. In such exhibitions  pharaohs such as Amenhotep II (ruled 14261400 BCE) never competed against anyone else  however  and there is reason to suspect that their extraordinary achievements were scribal fictions. Nonetheless  Egyptians with less claim to divinity wrestled  jumped  and engaged in ball games and stick fights. In paintings found at Beni Hassan  in a tomb dating from the Middle Kingdom (1938c. 1630 BCE)  there are studies of 406 pairs of wrestlers demonstrating their skill.
