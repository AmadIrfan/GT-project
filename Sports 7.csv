Sports,Since Minoan script still baffles scholars  it is uncertain whether images of Cretan boys and girls testing their acrobatic skills against bulls depict sport  religious ritual  or both. That the feats of the Cretans may have been both sport and ritual is suggested by evidence from Greece  where sports had a cultural significance unequaled anywhere else before the rise of modern sports. Secular and religious motives mingle in historys first extensive sports report  found in Book XXIII of Homers Iliad in the form of funeral games for the dead Patroclus. These games were part of Greek religion and were not  therefore  autotelic  the contests in the Odyssey  on the other hand  were essentially secular. Odysseus was challenged by the Phaeacians to demonstrate his prowess as an athlete. In general  Greek culture included both cultic sports  such as the Olympic Games honouring Zeus  and secular contests.The most famous association of sports and religion was certainly the Olympic Games  which Greek tradition dates from 776 BCE. In the course of time  the earth goddess Gaea  originally worshiped at Olympia  was supplanted in importance by the sky god Zeus  in whose honour priestly officials conducted quadrennial athletic contests. Sacred games also were held at Delphi (in honour of Apollo)  Corinth  and Nemea. These four events were known as the periodos  and great athletes  such as Theagenes of Thasos  prided themselves on victories at all four sites. Although most of the events contested at Greek sacred games remain familiar  the most important competition was the chariot race. The extraordinary prestige accorded athletic triumphs brought with it not only literary accolades (as in the odes of Pindar) and visual commemoration (in the form of statues of the victors) but also material benefits  contrary to the amateur myth propagated by 19th  century philhellenists. Since the Greeks were devoted to secular sports as well as to sacred games  no polis  or city  state  was considered a proper community if it lacked a gymnasium where  as the word gymnos indicates  naked male athletes trained and competed. Except in militaristic Sparta  Greek women rarely participated in sports of any kind. They were excluded from the Olympic Games even as spectators (except for the priestess of Demeter). The 2nd  century  CE traveler Pausanias wrote of races for girls at Olympia  but these events in honour of Hera were of minor importance. Rome Although chariot races were among the most popular sports spectacles of the Roman and Byzantine eras  as they had been in Greek times  the Romans of the republic and the early empire were quite selectively enthusiastic about Greek athletic contests. Emphasizing physical exercises for military preparedness  an important motive in all ancient civilizations  the Romans preferred boxing  wrestling  and hurling the javelin to running footraces and throwing the discus. The historian Livy wrote of Greek athletes appearing in Rome as early as 186 BCE  however  the contestants nudity shocked Roman moralists. The emperor Augustus instituted the Actian Games in 27 BCE to celebrate his victory over Antony and Cleopatra  and several of his successors began similar games  but it was not until the later empire  especially during the reign of Hadrian (117138 CE)  that many of the Roman elite developed an enthusiasm for Greek athletics.Greater numbers flocked to the chariot races held in Romes Circus Maximus. They were watched by as many as 250 000 spectators  five times the number that crowded into the Colosseum to enjoy gladiatorial combat. Nevertheless  there is some evidence that the latter contests were actually more popular than the former. Indeed  the munera  which pitted man against man  and the venationes  which set men against animals  became popular even in the Greek  speaking Eastern Empire  which historians once thought immune from the lust for blood. The greater frequency of chariot races can be explained in part by the fact that they were relatively inexpensive compared with the enormous costs of gladiatorial combat. The editor who staged the games usually rented the gladiators from a lanista (the manager of a troupe of gladiators) and was required to reimburse him for losers executed in response to a thumbs down sign. Brutal as these combats were  many of the gladiators were free men who volunteered to fight  an obvious sign of intrinsic motivation. Indeed  imperial edicts were needed to discourage the aristocracys participation. During the reign of Nero (5468)  female gladiators were introduced into the arena.
