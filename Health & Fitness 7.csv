Health & Fitness,How much exercise do I need? How much exercise you should be getting depends on several factors  including your current level of fitness  your fitness goals  the types of exercise youre planning to do  and whether you have deficits in such areas as strength  flexibility or balance. As a general rule  150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise) is recommended as a weekly minimum. As you become more fit  youll want to exceed that in order to reap maximum benefit. A natural way of splitting up the 150 minutes might be to do a 30  minute session five times per week  or you can break it up and do two 15  minute sessions during a single day. Adopt whatever schedule fits your lifestyle.For strength exercises  aim to work all your major muscle groups twice to three times each week  leaving 48 hours between each workout for recovery. If you do total  body workouts  thats two sessions per week. If you choose to split your workouts to target a specific muscle group (e.g.  leg day)  that will require more frequent workouts. Just make sure youre leaving 48 hours of rest before you re  work a major muscle. If you have noticed problems with your balance  such as unsteadiness  dizziness  or vertigo  talk to a healthcare provider for recommendations about balance  specific exercises. Get in three half  hour workouts each week in addition to a 30  minute walk at least twice weekly.Its best to stretch after you have warmed up for a few minutes  or perform  stretching exercises after you completed your workout. When stretching each muscle group  take it slow and steady  release  repeat again. But how much exercise is too much? You should expect a little muscle soreness after workouts  especially in the beginning. But if you find that your body is simply not recovering between workouts  you may be overtraining. Remember that seniors need more recovery time than younger people. With the exception of welcome muscle soreness  an exercise program should make you feel good. If it doesnt  youre probably overdoing it. That doesnt mean you should quit  only that you should dial back the intensity or frequency of your workouts until you hit the sweet spot in which youve tired out your body but then recovered enough to tackle your next session with enthusiasm.What are the benefits of exercise?A smartly designed exercise program will benefit your body and mind in innumerable ways.The benefits of exercise on mental health are well documented. For example  one major study found that sedentary people are 44% more likely to be depressed. Another found that those with mild to moderate depression could get similar results to those obtained through antidepressants just by exercising for 90 minutes each week. The key appears to be the release of brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine  which help lift mood and combat stress.Were all familiar with exercises ability to improve cardiovascular health. But how does exercise lower blood pressure? Interestingly  when you stimulate your circulatory system through aerobic exercise  youre temporarily increasing your blood pressure by forcing the system to work harderbut when youve finished exercising  your blood pressure drops to a lower level than it was before you began.Many people think of exercise as an integral part of weight lossand  although diet is also extremely important  theyre not wrong. But what exercise burns the most calories? Generally  aerobic exercises (cardio) are great for expending calories and reducing fat. But dont overlook the effectiveness of strength training  which optimizes your bodys ratio of lean muscle to fat (Its also the best exercise for bone strength). Theres no Holy Grail when it comes to a single best weight  loss exercise. The best exercise to lose weight is the one youll do consistently. Whatever gets your heart rate up and gets your body movingwhile having fun and staying motivatedis the exercise that will help you shed pounds.
