Sports,It was a superb Hollywood face  lift. By announcing a major overhaul in its controversial documentary nominating process  the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tried late last month to look good despite one of the most embarrassing and widely criticized episodes in its history the snubbing of Hoop Dreams  last years highly praised film about two teenage basketball hopefuls struggling to make it out of inner  city Chicago and into the pros. I dont know that any of these changes would have made any difference at all in the outcome of nominations  Academy president Arthur Hiller said in June. And indeed  many of the changes he announced seemed benign. From now on  branches in New York and Los Angeles will split the initial viewing of contenders for nominations  and a strange seven  point scoring system will be changed toa strange five  point scoring system. But the alterations are  in fact  intended to make certain that what happened to Hoop Dreams never happens to another film and although nobody at the Academy is using the word  Hillers own internal investigation appears to have revealed that Hoop Dreams omission was  indeed  something of a conspiracy. The outrage began on Valentines Day  when it became clear that the perennially controversial documentary nominating committee had failed to put Dreams on the ballot. Some on the committee insisted the outcry was being drummed up to sell tickets by the films distributor  Fine Line Features. (Even without a nomination  the film earned $7.8 million $ a strong showing for a nonfiction film.) The Academys documentary committee had been losing public trust for well over a decade by disdaining most of the breakout nonfiction films critics adored  the roster of documentaries that were never nominated includes Shoah  28 Up  The Thin Blue Line  Roger &amp Me  Paris Is Burning  Brothers Keeper  and Truth or Dare. Each year  committee members defended their choices by insisting theyd discovered five better films. But this year  the critics went wild when Hoop Dreams and Terry Zwigoffs Crumb were denied nominations  while among the final five was Maya Lin   A Strong Clear Vision  whose director  Freida Lee Mock  had chaired the committee for the previous two years. Mocks film went on to take the award. I call it cronyism  and this committee doesnt even understand what the word means  said Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan last March. All of the committee members know and like Freida. Its human nature for them to have a tendency to vote for her. Theyre a cosa nostra. Before the reforms  the committees elaborate yet primitive voting process had been to winnow down the entrants by shutting off the projector when more than half the viewing members deemed a film unworthy by shining flashlights. This year  a galaxy of penlights in the dark of the Academys stuffy third  floor screening room nixed Crumb after 55 minutes. Though the film went on to win the Sundance documentary competition and some of the years best reviews  one committee member who declined to be identified said  Id been shining my light for a good while before that. Whats good for Sundance is not necessarily fit for us.
