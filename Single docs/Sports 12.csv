Sports,Pakistan has an ice hockey team but it is not part of the IIHF. Pakistan applied for membership but the congress postponed it until it had a better structure. However  Pakistan has deep roots in ice hockey in the northern parts of   Glgit  Baltistan province. Pakistan  s first hockey game was played in Naltar The first hockey game in Pakistan took place in December 2018 in Naltar between the Pakistan Air Force and Gilgit Scouts.[56] Baltistan Ice Hockey Championship 2022 was held in Skardu on January 25  26  with teams named after glaciers  to raise awareness about climate change.The Pakistani team has participated in many of the international and regional tournaments and has achieved many successes. It has won the Asian Baseball Championship (C level) title in 2010  where they won 100 against Hong Kong in the final round [4] and five titles at the Asian Baseball Cup  winning the last tournament in 2015.[5] The team qualified for the World Baseball Classic qualifier round for the first time where they lost 010 against Brazil and 014 while competing against Great Britain in 2016.The latest landmark for Pakistan rugby is that universities like Lahore University of Management and Sciences (LUMS) and Bahria University Islamabad have formed teams as well.The game though remained mainly an expatriate sport  with KRFU being active on the All  India circuit up till the late fifties.[2] Records of teams containing Pakistani players exist going back to the 1950s  with an East Pakistan Rifles team beating Chittagong Rugby Club on 2 July 1955 at Niaz Stadium. The origin of football in Pakistan can be traced back to the mid  nineteenth century when the game was introduced during the British Raj. Initially  games were played between army teams. However  clubs were soon set up around the country.[42] One of the regional federations to organize football on what is now Pakistan Territory was the North  West India Football Association  in which clubs from the city of Lahore and the surrounding region were active.[43] Kohat FC was the first club to be established in 1930  it became the first outstation team to win the North  West India Football Championship 1937 in 1937 defeating Government College Lahore 10 in the finals.[43] The first female club to be established was Diya W.F.C. in 2002.[ Since Minoan script still baffles scholars  it is uncertain whether images of Cretan boys and girls testing their acrobatic skills against bulls depict sport  religious ritual  or both. That the feats of the Cretans may have been both sport and ritual is suggested by evidence from Greece  where sports had a cultural significance unequaled anywhere else before the rise of modern sports. Secular and religious motives mingle in historys first extensive sports report  found in Book XXIII of Homers Iliad in the form of funeral games for the dead Patroclus. These games were part of Greek religion and were not  therefore  autotelic  the contests in the Odyssey  on the other hand  were essentially secular. Odysseus was challenged by the Phaeacians to demonstrate his prowess as an athlete. In general  Greek culture included both cultic sports  such as the Olympic Games honouring Zeus  and secular contests.
