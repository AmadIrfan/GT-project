Health & Fitness,Its that time of year again   Theres fresh powder in the mountains  and many of us are eager to hit the slopes. However  along with the fun of skiing or snowboarding comes the risk of injury. On average  between two and four skiers per 1 000 are injured each day on the slopes in the U.S.  according to the UC Davis Health Sports Medicine team. Injury rates are similar for snowboarding. For skiers  the good news is that improvements in technology have slightly reduced injury rates. Shaped skis have allowed people to learn faster and stay in better control. Boot  top leg fractures (facture of your tibia or fibula) are less common. But knee sprains  shoulder injuries  and thumb sprains (such as skiers thumb) still occur. For snowboarders  injuries to the wrist  shoulder  and head are most common. Snow boarders tend to reach out their hands more during a fall  since both feet are locked onto the board.To help keep you safe on the slopes  here are some tips to avoid injury   Overall fitness and regular cardio exercises can help you prevent injury. Staying in shape is important. We have a list of exercises below to help strengthen your lower body and core. Warm up your muscles before you head down the mountain. Cold muscles are at a greater risk for injury. Gently stretch your hamstrings  quadriceps (thigh muscles)  hips  and calf muscles before and after skiing or snowboarding. Wear a helmet. If you fall  a properly fitted helmet can reduce the risk of ski and snowboard head injuries. Helmets can also provide protection in the event of a collision with someone who has lost control. Staying hydrated is also important before  during  and after skiing or snowboarding. When renting or buying ski or snowboard equipment  dont overstate your skill level. Make sure you get equipment that will be safe for you and your ability. Use ski poles without straps. That will allow you to release the pole during a mishap and prevents snags that cause injuries to your thumbs and arms. Rest when youre tired. Most injuries happen after lunchtime when fatigue sets in. Wear layered clothing to keep your body warm  along with sunglasses and/or goggles to protect your eyes. While UV rays from the sun may not be as strong during the winter  sunscreen is still important because the reflection off the snow amplifies the effects of UV rays. Youre also at higher elevation  making the suns effects stronger. Snowboarders should consider wearing wrist guards to protect them when falling. There are some exercises you can do at home to keep your body in shape for winter fun. Here are some recommendations from our sports medicine team to help you avoid injuries to your lower body   Plank Start by lying on your stomach and rise onto your toes and elbows with your forearms on the ground. Keep your elbows lined up vertically with your shoulders. Tighten your glutes and make sure your belly doesnt sag  but also make sure your buttocks arent lifted in the air. Engage your whole core. Your body should look like its one straight line from your legs to your head. Switch over to a slide plank to strengthen your oblique muscles of your core. Superman stability ball On a stability ball  lie on your stomach with your toes touching the ground. Raise your upper body and put your arms straight out in front of your head.

This includes your back muscles  glutes  hamstrings  and core. Strengthening these muscles is important because they help you stay upright as you go down the slopes.
