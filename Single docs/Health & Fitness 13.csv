Health & Fitness,High  intensity fitness programs are designed to burn fat and build muscle fast by stressing muscles more than other workouts. These programs can include high  intensity interval training or HIIT classes  such as Tabata. However  if they arent done properly  these workouts can lead to muscle and joint injuries.Before you think about starting high  intensity exercise  be sure youre able to do it safely. Our sports medicine team has some guidance and effective alternatives.What is an example of a high  intensity workout? High  intensity interval training  better known as HIIT  consists of short bursts of intense work that typically last between 15 seconds to 4 minutes. These are followed by a quick recovery period and then right back to the tough work. These cycles are repeated several times and can include a variety of exercises in each round. HIIT workouts can include the use of a stationary bike  treadmill  bodyweight  kettlebell  dumbbells  or jump rope. Another type of HIIT workout you may have heard of is called Tabata.What are the benefits of HIIT or other high  intensity exercises? HIIT and other high  intensity exercise programs help you burn a lot of calories in a short amount of time. Research has also showed that you keep burning calories for hours after your workout is finished. These workouts typically cause you to burn more fat and build muscle. Studies have also showed that high  intensity workouts may help lower blood pressure and heart rate.Can high  intensity exercise really be dangerous? The short answer is yes. However  the biggest danger to health is an inactive lifestyle  which is much more widespread than overdoing exercise. The goal should be to slowly overload the body for higher levels of performance  rather than to suddenly increase activity levels. While high  intensity exercise can lead to overuse injuries or muscle and joint injuries  these are less likely to occur with the right preparation.Are there any fitness trends that concern you? Any of the all  out group workouts that emphasize intensity instead of proper form and preparation can be a problem. These include programs that push you to do more sets and repetitions with heavier weights than youre comfortable with. Exercise should make you feel some burn in your muscles  but it should never be painful. Our UC Davis Health sports medicine physicians treat a lot of injuries related to these types of programs. Intensity can be great when done correctly. Too much  too soon is likely to cause problems.Why is it a problem for an inactive or casual fitness person to do intense fitness activities? The biggest issue is that moving regularly isnt something most people do. This can leave people who try to get in shape quickly more prone to injury.Inactive people who arent experienced with exercise or those who havent regularly exercised in a while tend to push themselves too much. In these situations  people often arent aware of how hard they can and should work. This is especially true for those who are doing a group workout. Can high  intensity exercise improve fitness? There are ways to mix in intensity and speed fitness  but that should not be the emphasis for most people. Start by moving more than you normally do throughout each day. This is more beneficial than a one tough workout every so often. At the same time  people who have been doing the same exercises for months are unlikely to get more fit unless they make changes. This could include changing their routines  pushing harder  and working beyond their comfort zones. What are some signs that youve gone too far with a workout? Pain is a big sign that a workout is causing trouble. If any exercise causes pain  dont push through it. Its a good idea to start slowly increasing physical activity and intensity. This will allow you to learn the difference between pain and being uncomfortable.
