Sports,n 2006  Pakistan Federation Baseball hosted the 7th Asian Baseball Championship [54] and again from 2010 through 2017  with the national team winning the tournament from 2010 through 2015.The Pakistan national baseball team is the national team representing Pakistan in international baseball tournaments and competitions. The team is controlled and governed by the Pakistan Federation Baseball  which is represented in the Baseball Federation of Asia (BFA)  having been ranked #5 in Asia  just behind China.[2] They are ranked as the top and one of the most successful baseball teams in South Asia  winning the first SAARC Baseball Championship 82 against Sri Lanka in 2011.[3] As of 2023  Pakistan is currently ranked 38th in the world by the World Baseball Softball Confederation.The Pakistani team has participated in many of the international and regional tournaments and has achieved many successes. It has won the Asian Baseball Championship (C level) title in 2010  where they won 100 against Hong Kong in the final round [4] and five titles at the Asian Baseball Cup  winning the last tournament in 2015.[5] The team qualified for the World Baseball Classic qualifier round for the first time where they lost 010 against Brazil and 014 while competing against Great Britain in 2016.Like in almost every South Asian country where baseball is a minor sport  Pakistan  s most popular sport is cricket  which diverts athletic talent away from baseball. As of 2023  Pakistan has never qualified for the World Baseball Classic.Pakistan have participated at the Asian Baseball Championship since 2003  and have competed in the competition ever since. The national team has struggled in competing against top Asian teams such as Japan  Chinese Taipei  and South Korea  among others. Pakistan secured fifth position after coming victorious against Indonesia in the 2015 Asian Baseball Championship.Pakistan have dominated the Asian Baseball Cup since its inception  and have competed in every year. Since 1997  Pakistan have never missed out on placing in the top 3 in any tournament  and is the only team to have achieved this feat. Pakistan also holds the record for most consecutive Asian Baseball Cup titles  having won five times in total  while the national team have been defending their title since the last four tournaments.The Asian Baseball Championship is the main championship tournament between national baseball teams in Asia  governed by the Baseball Federation of Asia (BFA).[1] [2] It is held every other year in odd  numbered years and since 1983 it also functions as the qualification games for the Baseball at the Summer Olympics if the event year is exactly one year before the Olympics.[3] In even  numbered years  the Asian Baseball Cup is held  to determine two qualifiers one from the Eastern Division and one from the Western Division to join teams from China  Taiwan  Japan  and South Korea. The competition has been dominated by teams from Japan  South Korea and Taiwan.As games  chess and basketball are obviously different from leapfrog and playing house. The first two games are competitive  the second two are not. One can win a game of basketball  but it makes no sense to ask who has won a game of leapfrog. In other words  chess and basketball are contests.
