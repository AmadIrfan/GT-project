In 2003  Pakistan fielded a national team for the first time  participating in the Provincial Tournament in Sri Lanka. In November 2004  it participated in the 19th Asian Championship in Hong Kong. The Pakistan Rugby Union then became an associate member of the International Rugby Board (IRB). There are three major clubs in Pakistan  which include Islamabad Rugby Football Club (IRFC) also known as the   JINNS    Lahore Rugby Football Club (LRFC)  and Karachi Rugby Football Club (KRFC). The latest landmark for Pakistan rugby is that universities like Lahore University of Management and Sciences (LUMS) and Bahria University Islamabad have formed teams as well.The Pakistan Rugby Union was formally established in 2000[1] and gained membership with the Asian Rugby Football Union in 2000. Pakistan Rugby Union then became an associate member of the IRB (International Rugby Board) in November 2003. Rugby has now been introduced at the Provincial and District level by the Pakistan Rugby Union. Schools have also been targeted for rugby to be introduced at the grass root level.Pakistani rugby goes as far back as 1926 when the Karachi Rugby Football Union was formed.[2] The game though remained mainly an expatriate sport  with KRFU being active on the All  India circuit up till the late fifties.[2] Records of teams containing Pakistani players exist going back to the 1950s  with an East Pakistan Rifles team beating Chittagong Rugby Club on 2 July 1955 at Niaz Stadium. Chittagong was made up from European players  while the Rifles were all Pakistani apart from their coach J.M. Reay.[3] The sixties saw a decrease in the expatriate population and travel to India becoming more regulated  therefore the club became more reliant on playing fixtures with visiting British Navy Ships  at a time when Karachi had become a regular port of call for R&R and supplies.[2] In 1968Â–1969 a handful of local players were introduced into the club   this would prove to be the saving grace for the game in the country. By the mid seventies the British Navy reduced its presence in the Indian Ocean and port visits became infrequent  and by the early eighties Rugby had become almost non  existent. The Karachi Rugby Football Union continued to play  yet due to limited funds it was unable to travel abroad for matches and suffered from lack of opposing teams to play within the country.The interest in rugby was rejuvenated in the nineties by a combination of passion and commitment of the locals who had been introduced to the game in the seventies and resurgence in the expatriate presence. Whilst some experienced local players established clubs in Lahore and Karachi  staff from foreign embassies  commissions and banks  consisting of Frenchmen  British  and some Americans  established a club in Islamabad. 1992 onwards has seen regular fixtures between teams from these cities. By the mid  nineties an Islamabad club called the Islamabad Rugby Football Club  consisting mainly of local players had also been established in addition to the side made up of expatriates  the latter passes through phases of dormancy subject to postings and availability of players. Lahore Rugby Football Club which was formed around the same time became their main competitors.
