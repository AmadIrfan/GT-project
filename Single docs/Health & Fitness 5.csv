Health & Fitness,Why is exercise so important for seniors? Whether you were once much more physically active or have never been one to exercise regularly  now is a great time to start an exercise and fitness regimen. Getting and staying in shape is just as important for seniors as it is for younger people. Why is exercise important for older people? Getting your heart rate up and challenging your muscles benefits virtually every system in your body and improves your physical and mental health in myriad ways. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy blood pressure  keeps harmful plaque from building up in your arteries  reduces inflammation  improves blood sugar levels  strengthens bones  and helps stave off depression. In addition  a regular exercise program can make your sex life better  lead to better quality sleep  reduce your risk of some cancers  and is linked to longer life. Many older adults hesitate to get moving because theyre unfamiliar with the types of exercise and fitness that are effective and safe  and arent sure how much exercise they need to do. The good news is that any kind of movement is better than being sedentary  so theres nothing wrong with starting small and working your way up to longer workouts. Your goal should be no less than 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week  but if you cant start at that level  work up to it (and then past it). While there are many dedicated forms of exercise and fitness for adults  you also want to stay physically active throughout the day by taking the stairs  doing yard work  and playing with your grandkids. When it comes to exercise and fitness for seniors  most can begin without consulting a doctorbut there are exceptions. If you have a major health condition like diabetes  high blood pressure  heart or lung disease  osteoprosis or a neurological disease  definitely talk to your doctor first. People with mobility issues such as poor balance or arthritis should also get advice from their doctor. What are the best types of exercise? While there are endless forms of exercise  experts categorize physical activity into four broad types based on what each calls upon your body to do and how the movement benefits you. Aerobic exercise is marked by an increased heart rate. Although most aerobic exercises require you to move your whole body  the main focus is on your heart and lungs (Aerobic exercise is often called cardio because it challenges and benefits your cardiovascular system). Activities like walking  swimming  dancing and cycling  if done at sufficient intensity  get you breathing faster and your heart working harder. Aerobic exercises burn fat  improve your mood  reduce inflammation and lower blood sugar. Strength training  sometimes called resistance training  should be performed two to three times a week. Squats  lunges  push  ups and the exercises performed on resistance machines or using weights or bands help maintain and even build muscle mass and strength. Strength training also helps prevent falls  keep bones strong  lower blood sugar levels  and improve balance. Do a combination of both isometric and isotonic exercises. Isometric exercises  such as doing planks and holding leg lifts  are done without movement. They are great for maintaining strength and improving stability. Isotonic exercises require you to bear weight throughout a range of motion. Bicep curls  bench presses and sit  ups are all forms of isotonic exercise. Stretching exercises keep your muscles and tendons flexible  preserve your posture  and improve mobility  especially as you age. Stretching can be done every day. Balance exercises call on the various systems that help you stay upright and oriented  such as those of the inner ear  vision and muscles and joints. Tai chi and yoga are great forms of balance exercises that can help you avoid falls and stay independent well into your senior years.
