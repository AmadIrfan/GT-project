Health & Fitness,What if my exercise ability is limited? Everyone can and should do some form of exercise  even if they face severe limitations. Experts have designed specific exercises for seniors that are low  impact  safe and able to be done even from a sitting position if necessary. If youre concerned about fall risk  balance exercises for seniors can be done holding onto a chair or doorframe. For example  standing behind a chair  you can hold its back and lift one leg to about the height of the middle of the calf of the other leg while tightening your abdominal muscles. As you progress  you might try holding the chair with just one hand and eventually letting go of the chair. Even core  strengthening exercises for seniors can be adapted to those with limited abilities. For example  a standard plank is done by holding yourself parallel to the floor with only your forearms and toes touching the mat. An easier version allows you to also place your knees on the mat. But a still easier method is to do the plank while standing and leaning forward. You put your elbows and forearms on a desk  table or wall while resting on the balls of your feet and keeping your back straight. There are a variety of stretching exercises for seniors to suit people of different abilities. If holding poses on your hands and knees is out of the question  you could try a full  body stretch in which you lie on your back  straighten your legs and extend your hands along the floor past your head. Some stretches can be done while seated  such as overhead stretches and neck rotations. In fact  other types of exercise also can be done from a seated position. Other chair exercises for seniors include bicep curls (with dumbbells or elastic bands)  overhead dumbbell presses  shoulder blade squeezes  calf raises  sit  to  stands (chair squats) and knee extensions. What exercises are best for heart health? The best exercise program will incorporate both aerobic and strength training  since thats the best way to strengthen your entire body  improve your endurance and ensure your long  term health. But if your main concern is how to improve cardiovascular health  then you should put a premium on cardiovascular exercises that force your heart and lungs to work harder  sending oxygen to your cells. While strength training certainly does have cardiovascular benefits  cardio workouts excel when it comes to reducing blood pressure  maintaining the health of the inner walls of your arteries  releasing enzymes that break down blood clots  and even promoting the growth of new arteries feeding the heart. Regular aerobic exercise also significantly lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although diabetes usually isnt thought of as a heart problem  a lower risk of diabetes also lowers the risk of heart disease  since high blood sugar takes a toll on blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart. When you exercise  you call on your bodys cells to take glucose (sugar) out of the blood  which they do by becoming more sensitive to insulin  the hormone crucial to glucose metabolism. That means your cells remain insulin  sensitive long after youre finished exercising. And since obesity is a significant risk for diabetes  exercises that help you shed fatespecially around your middlewill help you keep diabetes at bay.
