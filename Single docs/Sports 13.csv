Sports,Main article   Rugby union in Pakistan Rugby team of Karachi  c. 1934 The Pakistan Rugby Union was formally established in 2000 and gained memberships with the Asian Rugby Football Union in 2000. In 2003  Pakistan fielded a national team for the first time  participating in the Provincial Tournament in Sri Lanka. In November 2004  it participated in the 19th Asian Championship in Hong Kong. Since Minoan script still baffles scholars  it is uncertain whether images of Cretan boys and girls testing their acrobatic skills against bulls depict sport  religious ritual  or both. That the feats of the Cretans may have been both sport and ritual is suggested by evidence from Greece  where sports had a cultural significance unequaled anywhere else before the rise of modern sports. Secular and religious motives mingle in historys first extensive sports report  found in Book XXIII of Homers Iliad in the form of funeral games for the dead Patroclus. These games were part of Greek religion and were not  therefore  autotelic  the contests in the Odyssey  on the other hand  were essentially secular. Odysseus was challenged by the Phaeacians to demonstrate his prowess as an athlete. In general  Greek culture included both cultic sports  such as the Olympic Games honouring Zeus  and secular contests. The Pakistan Rugby Union then became an associate member of the International Rugby Board (IRB). There are three major clubs in Pakistan  which include Islamabad Rugby Football Club (IRFC) also known as the   JINNS    Lahore Rugby Football Club (LRFC)  and Karachi Rugby Football Club (KRFC). The latest landmark for Pakistan rugby is that universities like Lahore University of Management and Sciences (LUMS) and Bahria University Islamabad have formed teams as well . As games  chess and basketball are obviously different from leapfrog and playing house. The first two games are competitive  the second two are not. One can win a game of basketball  but it makes no sense to ask who has won a game of leapfrog. In other words  chess and basketball are contests. The game though remained mainly an expatriate sport  with KRFU being active on the All  India circuit up till the late fifties.[2] Records of teams containing Pakistani players exist going back to the 1950s  with an East Pakistan Rifles team beating Chittagong Rugby Club on 2 July 1955 at Niaz Stadium. Chittagong was made up from European players  while the Rifles were all Pakistani apart from their coach J.M. Reay.[3] The sixties saw a decrease in the expatriate population and travel to India becoming more regulated  therefore the club became more reliant on playing fixtures with visiting British Navy Ships  at a time when Karachi had become a regular port of call for R&R and supplies.[2] In 19681969 a handful of local players were introduced into the club   this would prove to be the saving grace for the game in the country. By the mid seventies the British Navy reduced its presence in the Indian Ocean and port visits became infrequent  and by the early eighties Rugby had become almost non  existent. The Karachi Rugby Football Union continued to play  yet due to limited funds it was unable to travel abroad for matches and suffered from lack of opposing teams to play within the country.
