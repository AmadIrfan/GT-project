Health & Fitness,Athletes have an ever  expanding variety of pills  powders  drinks  and other tools to choose from that promise to make them faster  stronger and bigger.Sales figures indicate that many athletes and fitness gurus have bought into that promise. But it  s largely an empty one. Performance supplements should not be a substitute for healthy nutrition and drinking water.Research on exercise supplements There  s no scientific evidence to support products that claim they  ll increase muscle size  strength  energy or athletic performance. But many athletes look for any way to gain an edge on their competition or quickly reach their personal goals.People are often swayed by clever marketing techniques  videos on social media  or professional athletes who endorse nutritional supplements. Often    experts   who aren  t qualified or don  t have a background in nutrition make inaccurate claims about these products.Because there is no standard for many of these supplements  it can be common to find several different chemical formulas  depending on the company. Each one claims it contains the same vital compound.Safety information on protein supplements Supplements for amino acids  the building blocks for protein  are promoted as helping build muscle. However  the average American diet already has two  to  three times more protein than is needed. It  s also important to note that high levels of specific amino acids can potentially produce a toxic effect. It can place an extra burden on your kidneys and contribute to kidney failure in the long  term. Unnecessarily adding individual vitamins and minerals into your diet can also create imbalances within your body. This can lead to major changes or long  term health effects. Unnecessary supplements can be potentially toxic and may reduce your body  s ability to absorb other nutrients.One example comes from a 2022 report released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The report included information that some bodybuilding products posed serious health risks. The FDA found that some products that claimed to help build muscle mass and strength illegally contained steroids or steroid  like substances that can cause series liver injury. Many of these bodybuilding products were labeled as   dietary supplements   in stores and online. This all came to light after the FDA received hundreds of reports of adverse reactions to some supplements.In cases like this  it can be hard for the FDA to regulate and find the sellers  especially if the products are sold only online. Retailers and websites will often change their name or relabel their products to evade authorities and scam customers  according to the FDA. Sports drink intake should be rare Sports drinks are popular  but they should be used properly. The purpose of these beverages is to provide fluid  carbohydrates (carbs) and electrolytes during long endurance events. These are times where energy stores are low  and water and electrolytes are lost in sweat. In these cases  sports drinks can support athletic performance and help with recovery. Sports drinks should not be the main source of fluid in your diet. They add extra calories  which can hinder weight goals. They also have added sodium  which may be unnecessary and can contribute to high blood pressure. If you exercise for less than an hour in a mild environment  water is the only thing you should need. It  s enough to refuel your body during exercise. A well  balanced diet and plenty of water is enough As long as athletes eat a well  balanced diet and drink plenty of water  that should be all that they need. A lot of people use products that are not scientifically sound. Some of them aren  t even regulated by the FDA. And to top it off  supplements can quickly gobble up your money. Athletes who need more carbs than the normal person are those who participate in long events  such as triathlons or marathons. But even those athletes simply need more food and liquid in their diets in the form of carbs and electrolytes to replace losses. If you  re interested in using any supplement  talk to your health care provider. You should also consider buying from companies that receive third  party testing. Checking for an NSF certification ensures the product is made with good manufacturing practices.
