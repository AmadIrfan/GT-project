Sports,Like the highly evolved civilizations of which they are a part  traditional Asian sports are ancient and various. Competitions were never as simple as they seemed to be. From the Islamic Middle East across the Indian subcontinent to China and Japan  wrestlersmostly but not exclusively maleembodied and enacted the values of their cultures. The wrestlers strength was always more than a merely personal statement. More often than not  the men who strained and struggled understood themselves to be involved in a religious endeavour. Prayers  incantations  and rituals of purification were for centuries an important aspect of the hand  to  hand combat of Islamic wrestlers. It was not unusual to combine the skills of the wrestler with those of a mystic poet. Indeed  the celebrated 14th  century Persian pahlavan (ritual wrestler) Ma?m?d Khw?rezm? was both.Typical of the place of sport within a religious context was the spectacle of 50 sturdy Turks who wrestled in Istanbul in 1582 to celebrate the circumcision of the son of Murad III. When Indian wrestlers join an akhara (gymnasium)  they commit themselves to the quest for a holy life. As devout Hindus  they recite mantras as they do their knee bends and push  ups. In their struggle against pollution  they strictly control their diet  sexual habits  breathing  and even their urination and defecation.While the religious aspects of Turkish and Iranian houses of strength (where weightlifting and gymnastics were practiced) became much less salient in the course of the 20th century  the elders in charge of Japanese sumo added a number of Shint? elements to the rituals of their sport to underscore their claim that it is a unique expression of Japanese tradition. A somewhat arbitrary distinction can be made between wrestling and the many forms of unarmed hand  to  hand combat categorized as martial arts. The emphasis of the latter is military rather than religious  instrumental rather than expressive. Chinese wushu (military skill)  which included armed as well as unarmed combat  was highly developed by the 3rd century BCE. Its unarmed techniques were especially prized within Chinese culture and were an important influence on the martial arts of Korea  Japan  and Southeast Asia. Much less well known in the West are varma adi (hitting the vital spots) and other martial arts traditions of South Asia. In the early modern era  as unarmed combat became obsolete  the emphasis of Asian martial arts tended to shift back toward religion. This shift can often be seen in the language of sports. Japanese kenjutsu (techniques of the sword) became kend? (the way of the sword).Of the armed (as opposed to unarmed) martial arts  archery was among the most important in the lives of Asian warriors from the Arabian to the Korean peninsulas. Notably  the Japanese samurai practiced many forms of archery  the most colourful of which was probably yabusame  whose mounted contestants drew their bows and loosed their arrows while galloping down a straight track some 720 to 885 feet (220 to 270 metres) long. They were required to shoot in quick succession at three small targetseach about 9 square inches (55 square cm) placed on 3  foot   (0.9  metre  ) high poles 23 to 36 feet (7 to 11 metres) from the track and spaced at intervals of 235 to 295 feet (71.5 to 90 metres). In yabusame  accuracy was paramount.In Turkey  where the composite (wood plus horn) bow was an instrument of great power  archers competed for distance. At Istanbuls Okmeydan? (Arrow Field)  the record was set in 1798 when Selim IIIs arrow flew more than 2 900 feet (884 metres).
