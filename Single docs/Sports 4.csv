Sports,No one can say when sports began. Since it is impossible to imagine a time when children did not spontaneously run races or wrestle  it is clear that children have always included sports in their play  but one can only speculate about the emergence of sports as autotelic physical contests for adults. Hunters are depicted in prehistoric art  but it cannot be known whether the hunters pursued their prey in a mood of grim necessity or with the joyful abandon of sportsmen. It is certain  however  from the rich literary and iconographic evidence of all ancient civilizations that hunting soon became an end in itselfat least for royalty and nobility. Archaeological evidence also indicates that ball games were common among ancient peoples as different as the Chinese and the Aztecs. If ball games were contests rather than noncompetitive ritual performances  such as the Japanese football game kemari  then they were sports in the most rigorously defined sense. That it cannot simply be assumed that they were contests is clear from the evidence presented by Greek and Roman antiquity  which indicates that ball games had been for the most part playful pastimes like those recommended for health by the Greek physician Galen in the 2nd century CE.It is unlikely that the 7th  century Islamic conquest of North Africa radically altered the traditional sports of the region. As long as wars were fought with bow and arrow  archery contests continued to serve as demonstrations of ready prowess. The prophet Muhammad specifically authorized horse races  and geography dictated that men race camels as well as horses. Hunters  too  took their pleasures on horseback.Among the many games of North Africa was ta kurt om el mahag (the ball of the pilgrims mother)  a Berber bat  and  ball contest whose configuration bore an uncanny resemblance to baseball. Koura  more widely played  was similar to football (soccer).Cultural variation among black Africans was far greater than among the Arab peoples of the northern littoral. Ball games were rare  but wrestling of one kind or another was ubiquitous. Wrestlings forms and functions varied from tribe to tribe. For the Nuba of southern Sudan  ritual bouts  for which mens bodies were elaborately decorated as well as carefully trained  were the primary source of male status and prestige. The Tutsi and Hutu of Rwanda were among the peoples who staged contests between females. Among the various peoples of sub  Saharan Africa  wrestling matches were a way to celebrate or symbolically encourage human fertility and the earths fecundity. In southern Nigeria  for instance  Igbo tribesmen participated in wrestling matches held every eighth day throughout the three months of the rainy season  hard  fought contests  it was thought  persuaded the gods to grant abundant harvests of corn (maize) and yams. Among the Diola of the Gambia  adolescent boys and girls wrestled (though not against one another) in what was clearly a prenuptial ceremony. Male champions were married to their female counterparts. In other tribes  such as the Yala of Nigeria  the Fon of Benin  and the Njabi of the Congo  boys and girls grappled with each other. Among the Kole  it was the kin of the bride and the bridegroom who wrestled. Stick fights  which seem to have been less closely associated with religious practices  were common among many tribes  including the Zulu and Mpondo of southern Africa.Contests for runners and jumpers were to be found across the length and breadth of the continent. During the age of imperialism  explorers and colonizers were often astonished by the prowess of these primitive peoples. Nandi runners of Kenyas Rift Valley seemed to run distances effortlessly at a pace that brought European runners to pitiable physical collapse. Tutsi high jumpers of Rwanda and Burundi soared to heights that might have seemed incredible had not the jumpers been photographed in flight by members of Adolf Friedrich zu Mecklenburgs anthropological expedition at the turn of the 20th century.
