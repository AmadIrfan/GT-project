Physical activity immediately boosts the brains dopamine  norepinephrine  and serotonin levelsall of which affect focus and attention.

Exercise and PTSD and trauma Evidence suggests that by really focusing on your body and how it feels as you exercise  you can actually help your nervous system become unstuck and begin to move out of the immobilization stress response that characterizes PTSD or trauma. Instead of allowing your mind to wander  pay close attention to the physical sensations in your joints and muscles  even your insides as your body moves. Exercises that involve cross movement and that engage both arms and legssuch as walking (especially in sand)  running  swimming  weight training  or dancingare some of your best choices. Outdoor activities like hiking  sailing  mountain biking  rock climbing  whitewater rafting  and skiing (downhill and cross  country) have also been shown to reduce the symptoms of PTSD.
