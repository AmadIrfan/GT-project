Health & Fitness,Reaping the mental health benefits of exercise is easier than you think You dont need to devote hours out of your busy day to train at the gym  sweat buckets  or run mile after monotonous mile to reap all the physical and mental health benefits of exercise. Just 30  minutes of moderate exercise five times a week is enough. And even that can be broken down into two 15  minute or even three 10  minute exercise sessions if thats easier.Even a little bit of activity is better than nothing If you dont have time for 15 or 30 minutes of exercise  or if your body tells you to take a break after 5 or 10 minutes  for example  thats okay  too. Start with 5   or 10  minute sessions and slowly increase your time. The more you exercise  the more energy youll have  so eventually youll feel ready for a little more. The key is to commit to some moderate physical activity혰however little혰on most days. As exercising becomes a habit  you can slowly add extra minutes or try different types of activities. If you keep at it  the benefits of exercise will begin to pay off.You dont have to suffer to get results Research shows that moderate levels of exercise are best for most people. Moderate means   That you breathe a little heavier than normal  but are not out of breath. For example  you should be able to chat with your walking partner  but not easily sing a song. That your body feels warmer as you move  but not overheated or very sweaty. Cant find time to exercise during the week? Be a weekend warrior A recent study in the United Kingdom found that people who squeeze their exercise routines into one or two sessions during the weekend experience almost as many health benefits as those who work out more often. So dont let a busy schedule at work  home  or school be an excuse to avoid activity. Get moving whenever you can find the time혰your mind and body will thank you! Overcoming obstacles to exercise Even when you know that exercise will help you feel better  taking that first step is still easier said than done. Obstacles to exercising are very real혰particularly when youre also struggling with a mental health issue. Here are some common barriers and how you can get past them. Feeling exhausted. When youre tired  depressed  or stressed  it seems that working out will just make you feel worse. But the truth is that physical activity is a powerful energizer. Studies show that regular exercise can dramatically reduce fatigue and increase your energy levels. If you are really feeling tired  promise yourself a quick  5  minute walk. Chances are  once you get moving youll have more energy and be able to walk for longer.Feeling overwhelmed. When youre stressed or depressed  the thought of adding another obligation to your busy daily schedule can seem overwhelming. Working out just doesnt seem practical. If you have children  finding childcare while you exercise can also be a big hurdle. However  if you begin thinking of physical activity as a priority (a necessity for your mental well  being)  youll soon find ways to fit small amounts of exercise into even the busiest schedule.
