Health & Fitness,Feeling hopeless. Even if youve never exercised before  you can still find ways to comfortably get active. Start slow with easy  low  impact activities a few minutes each day  such as walking or dancing. Feeling bad about yourself. Are you your own worst critic? Its time to try a new way of thinking about your body. No matter your weight  age or fitness level  there are plenty of others in the same boat. Ask a friend to exercise with you. Accomplishing even the smallest fitness goals will help you gain body confidence and improve how you think about yourself. Feeling pain. If you have a disability  severe weight problem  arthritis  or any injury or illness that limits your mobility  talk to your doctor about ways to safely exercise. You shouldnt ignore pain  but rather do what you can  when you can. Divide your exercise into shorter  more frequent chunks of time if that helps  or try exercising in water to reduce joint or muscle discomfort. Getting started with exercise when you have a mental health issue Many of us find it hard enough to motivate ourselves to exercise at the best of times. But when you feel depressed  anxious  stressed or have another mental health problem  it can seem doubly difficult. This is especially true of depression and anxiety  which can leave you feeling trapped in a catch  22 situation. You know exercise will make you feel better  but depression has robbed you of the energyand motivation you need to work out  or your social anxiety means you cant bear the thought of being seen at an exercise class or running through the park. Start small. When youre under the cloud of anxiety or depression and havent exercised for a long time  setting extravagant goals like completing a marathon or working out for an hour every morning will only leave you more despondent if you fall short. Better to set achievable goals and build up from there.Schedule workouts when your energy is highest. Perhaps you have most energy first thing in the morning before work or school or at lunchtime before the mid  afternoon lull hits? Or maybe you do better exercising for longer at the weekends. If depression or anxiety has you feeling tired and unmotivated all day long  try dancing to some music or simply going for a walk. Even a short  15  minute walk can help clear your mind  improve your mood  and boost your energy level. As you move and start to feel a little better  youll often boost your energy enough to exercise more vigorouslyby walking further  breaking into a run  or adding a bike ride  for example.Focus on activities you enjoy. Any activity that gets you moving counts. That could include throwing a Frisbee with a dog or friend  walking laps of a mall window shopping  or cycling to the grocery store. If youve never exercised before or dont know what you might enjoy  try a few different things. Activities such as gardening or tackling a home improvement project can be great ways to start moving more when you have a mood disorderas well as helping you become more active  they can also leave you with a sense of purpose and accomplishment.
